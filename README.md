**Step 1: User Registration**

- User starts by registering with their email, password, and username.

**Step 2: Login to Home Page**

- After successful registration, the user can log in.

**Step 3: Home Page - Add Tasks**

- Once logged in, the user is directed to the home page.
- On the home page, the user can add tasks to their to-do list.

**Step 4: Task Completion and Logout**

These steps provide a clear sequence of actions for users in your React-based Todo List application, starting from registration, proceeding to task management, and ending with the option to log out.
